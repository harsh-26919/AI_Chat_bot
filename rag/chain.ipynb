You\\nlook for her green dress amid the sea of colors. You try to catch the sound of her voice in the gen-\\neral roar. There she is! Somehow, above the loud music and noisy conversation, now you hear her\\ncalling your name. But before you can move very far, you are stopped in your tracks by the sound\\nof shattering glass—you turn your head sharply and see that a pitcher has fallen off a nearby table.\\nWhile others tend to the glass, you set of f across the crowded room toward your friend.\\nThe processes by which you were able to spot your friend, hear your name despite the\\nnoise of the party, and then quickly turn toward and then away from the sound of the break-\\ning glass involved attention. In the context of human information processing, attention is the\\nprocess that, at a given moment, enhances some information and inhibits other information.\\nThe enhancement enables us to select some information for further processing, and the in-\\nhibition enables us to set some information aside.\\nThroughout life—indeed, throughout the day and throughout the minute—we are bom-\\nbarded by an overwhelming amount of perceptual information; the party is simply a highly\\ndramatic example of what’s going on all the time.

How do\\nwe, moment to moment, choose the information that is meaningful and avoid distraction by\\nirrelevant material? One solution is to focus on some particular piece of information (such as\\nthe sound of your own name or a color of interest) and to select it for processing in preference\\nto other bits of available information because of its immediate importance in a given situation.\\nIs attention, then, something that we summon up by will that enables concentration on some\\npiece of the incoming stimuli? The answer, briefly, is yes; but this is not the whole story. Even\\nif our intentions and goals are clear and we know exactly what information we are interested\\nin, other aspects of the input, if sufficiently salient, can capture our attention and distract us,\\nas the sudden noise of breaking glass interrupted your search for your friend.\\nA host of questions immediately arises: while we are attending to one thing, do we ac-\\ntively inhibit and suppress distractions, or do we simply ignore them and let them hover in the\\nbackground? What happens to the information to which we do not attend? What brain sys-\\ntems and mechanisms underlie these attentional abilities, and what disorders arise when\\nthese systems and mechanisms are damaged?\\nThis chapter explores attention as a cognitive ability. We specifically address four issues:\\n1. What is attention, and how does it operate during cognition?\\n2. What information-processing models have been devised to understand attention?\\n3. How have new techniques for studying the brain enhanced our understanding of\\nattention?\\n4. Attention, according to one contemporary theory, is a competition among different\\nsources of information, all jockeying for further processing. Can such a theory ex-\\nplain both the behavioral and brain perspectives on attention?\\n1. THE NATURE AND ROLES OF ATTENTION\\nAlthough we have an intuitive understanding of what it means to “pay attention” to\\nan object or event, the study of attention has a long and checkered history in cogni-\\ntive psychology, filled with debate and disagreement. Some have suggested that\\n“everyone knows what attention is;” others have countered that “no one knows what\\nattention is” (Pashler, 1998). For example, Moray (1970) proposed six different mean-\\nings of the term attention, whereas Posner and Boies (1971) suggested that attention\\nhas three components: orienting to sensory events, detecting signals for focused pro-\\ncessing, and maintaining a vigilant or alert state. Still others have used terms such as\\narousal, effort, capacity, perceptual set, control, and consciousness as synonymous\\nwith the process of attention. Adding to the difficulty is the problem of designing and\\ncarrying out careful and systematic studies of attention, for the very reason that at-\\ntentional selection seems to occur so naturally and effortlessly that it is difficult to pin\\ndown experimentally.\\nNonetheless, there is broad agreement that attention involves selecting some in-\\nformation for further processing and inhibiting other information from receiving\\nfurther processing. One possible way to understand how this might work is to ex-\\nplore what happens when attention fails. After this, we will examine what happens\\nwhen attention succeeds. Outlining the failures and successes will allow us to develop\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 104 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

Thereafter, we will present some theories of atten-\\ntion and some experiments that look at how attention operates in the brain.\\n1.1. Failures of Selection\\nWhen we fail to attend to information, what kind of information do we miss? One sort\\nof failure occurs when there is a lot of information simultaneously present in front of\\nyou, as at a party, and you are simply not capable of noticing all of it at once. These fail-\\nures are referred to as failures of selection in space . Failure can also occur with informa-\\ntion that unfolds in time. When new information (even if only a small amount) arrives in\\na rapid stream, spending time processing it will cause you to miss some other incoming\\ninformation, resulting in what are called failures of selection in time . These failures to\\nattend to information in space or in time are a by-product of a system that prevents us\\nfrom becoming overloaded with irrelevant information—that is, of a system of selective\\nattention. As such, these failures are an important part of effective cognitive processing\\nand highlight the function of attention. Later, when we come to theories of attention, it\\nwill be important to remember that understanding attention is as much about informa-\\ntion that is not selected as well as information that is selected. In the following subsec-\\ntions, we provide illustrative examples of failures and successes of attentional selection.\\n1.1.1. Failures of Selection in Space\\nFailures of selection in space can be of surprising magnitude. You’d notice, wouldn’t\\nyou, if someone who stopped you on the street to ask for directions suddenly changed\\ninto a different person in the middle of the conversation. Actually, you might not.\\nDemonstrations of the failure to detect changes between flashes of the same scene have\\nnow been replicated many times. Perhaps the most dramatic of these was a demon-\\nstration by Simons and Levin (1998) in which an experimenter stopped pedestrians on\\na college campus to ask for directions. During each conversation, two people carrying\\na door walked between the experimenter and the pedestrian. As they did, the experi-\\nmenter switched places with a second experimenter who had been concealed behind\\nthe door as it was being carried. This second experimenter then continued the conver-\\nsation with the pedestrian. Only half the pedestrians reported noticing the change of\\nspeaker—even when they were explicitly asked, “Did you notice that I am not the\\nsame person who first approached you to ask for directions?” This failure to detect\\nchanges in the physical aspects of a scene has been referred to as change blindness\\n(Simons & Rensink, 2005). This phenomenon often goes to the movies: errors in con-\\ntinuity, such as the switch from the breakfast croissant to the pancake in Pretty\\nWoman, go unnoticed by many in the audience. We can also be insensitive to changes\\nin modalities other than vision. It has been shown that we miss changes between voices\\nin an auditory scene, a phenomenon referred to as change deafness (Vitevitch, 2003).\\nThat we miss some perceptual information is interesting. Even more interest-\\ning from a cognitive perspective is the implication that this does not occur by\\nchance: we are selecting only partial information from the world around us and\\nare not very attentive to the rest. Change blindness indicates that not all available\\ninformation is attended and subsequently represented. Fortunately for our evolu-\\ntionary survival, those aspects of the input that are more relevant and meaningful\\n1.

This finding suggests that although\\nFIGURE 3–1 Changes in the scene\\n(a) A change of marginal interest (the height of the railing) and (b) a change of central interest (the po-\\nsition of the distant helicopter).

If\\nyou’re hungry, you may notice a basket of luscious-looking fruit on a nearby table—\\nbut if you’ve just eaten, your attention may glide right over it with barely a pause.\\nKnowledge, beliefs, goals and expectations can alter the speed and accuracy of the\\nprocesses that select meaningful or desired information; that’s what is happening\\nwhen you rapidly scan a book to find a particular reference and are able to skip over\\nlarge, irrelevant passages of material. The ability to use top-down processing to af-\\nfect selection and attention is highly adaptive and such processing is an efficient way\\nof extracting critical information from a flood of input.\\nHowever, because of the wealth of competing stimuli, top-down attentional selec-\\ntion does not always lead immediately to your goal. For example, in the opening scene\\nat the party, the moment you recognized that the flash of green was your friend’s dress\\nwas probably not the first moment that patch of green had appeared in your visual\\nfield, and the first time you heard your name was probably not the first time your\\nfriend had called to you. Further, you were actively diverted from looking for your\\nfriend by the sound of the crashing glass—your top-down processing was overridden\\nby a sensory event, that is, by bottom-up attentional processing. The result? Failure in\\nspace: attention was captured away from the current goal of seeking your friend.\\nFailures to select information in space can also occur when far fewer stimuli are\\npresent. For instance, if you are presented with only two sources of information\\nsimultaneously (say, a drama on television and a story in the newspaper) and are\\nrequired to process both, you will not be able to do them both full justice. The ability\\nto attend to two sources is impaired compared to the ability to process information\\nfrom one source alone: there is a cost associated with doing both tasks together.\\nWhen you try to do both things at once, there are two possibilities: either you will\\nfollow the television plot perfectly and lose the news story altogether (or the other\\nway round), or you will lose parts of both show and story.\\nConcentration on one source of input to the exclusion of any other is known\\nas focused attention ; in cases of divided attention , in which more than one source\\nis attended, the information selected is imperfect (as in the example of following\\npart of the newspaper story and part of the television story). One explanation for\\nthe loss of information when attention is divided is that the two sources of infor-\\nmation vie for limited attentional resources, which are sometimes described as\\n“mental effort.” An oversimplified but helpful image is that we each have a pool\\nof attentional effort into which each task taps. The harder the tasks, and the more\\nof them there are at any one time, the more of such “mental effort” is drawn from\\nthe pool. When the available capacity is less than that required for completion of\\na task, failures are more frequent. When tasks are easier or fewer, there is less de-\\nmand on this limited resource.\\nOne clear example of what happens when attention is divided comes from a\\nstudy conducted by Neisser and Becklen (1975). Participants were shown two\\n1. The Nature and Roles of Attention 107\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/13/06  8:45 AM  Page 107 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

In one, two people were playing a hand game in\\nwhich one player tries to slap the opponent’s hand; in the other, three men were\\nthrowing a basketball and moving about (Figure 3–2).

Yet this is\\nexactly what, after much practice with simulations, highly trained air traffic con-\\ntrollers do, with many simultaneous stimuli to monitor (Figure 3–3). Fortunately,\\nthose who do this kind of work have sufficient expertise and skill that failures are\\nextremely rare.\\n1.1.2. Failures of Selection in Time\\nJust as there are limitations on the quantity of information that can be processed si-\\nmultaneously in space, there are limitations on the speed with which information\\ncan be processed in temporal sequence. These limitations, of differing degree and\\nquality, apply to everyone.\\nPerhaps the simplest way to determine how fast information can be processed is\\nto ask participants to report the presence of stimuli shown in a rapid sequence. Re-\\nsearchers interested in the question of the temporal constraints of attention have de-\\nveloped experiments that push the attentional processing system to its limit.

The interesting finding is that, in the dual-report condition, participants\\nfailed to report T2 on the occasions when it appeared between about 100 and 500 mil-\\nliseconds after an appearance of T1 (remember, other letters intervene). After greater\\ndelays between an appearance of T1 and an appearance of T2, however, participants\\nwere again able to spot the T2. The decrease in performance in reporting a T2 if it ap-\\npears within a certain temporal window following the appearance of a T1 is an in-\\nstance of attentional blink. As the term suggests, attentional blink is a short period\\nduring which incoming information is not registered, similar in effect to the physical\\nblanking out of visual information during the blink of an eye. The phenomenon of at-\\ntentional blink also occurs for two objects (not just letters) that are presented in rapid\\nsuccession (Raymond, 2003). The hallmark of attentional blink is the missed detection\\nof a stimulus that is presented within a particular time frame after an earlier stimulus\\nis presented. When stimuli are presented so quickly, attention to the first seems to pre-\\nclude attention to the second—showing the failure to select items in time.\\nA similar effect involves the failure to detect objects presented in a rapid sequence\\nwhen some of these stimuli are identical, even when the stimuli are shown for a long\\nenough time to avoid the attentional blink. For example, Kanwisher and colleagues\\n(1997b) showed participants a sequence of nine serially presented displays with two\\nor three consecutive pictures sandwiched in between visually “noisy” patterns called\\nmasks (Figure 3–5). A large masking field was also shown at the beginning and end\\nof each trial. Each image was shown for 100 milliseconds. The important finding is\\nthat when the first and third picture in the series were identical, participants were\\nmarkedly less likely to report seeing the third picture (the repeat). This was also true\\nwhen the first and third pictures depicted the same object even if the objects were of\\n(a)\\n(b)\\nFIGURE 3–5 A demonstration of repetition blindness\\nMasks and (center) representational pictures were shown to participants.

When the two pictures were\\nof different objects, however, participants had no problem identifying the third pic-\\nture. The failure to detect the later appearance of a stimulus when the stimuli are pre-\\nsented in a rapid sequence has been termed repetition blindness (Kanwisher, 1987).\\nRepetition blindness can occur for words as well as for objects. For example,\\nwhen the sentence “It was work time so work had to get done” was presented rap-\\nidly, participants failed to detect the second occurrence of “work” and recalled the\\nsequence as “It was work time so had to get done” (Kanwisher, 1991). Blindness to\\na repetition can also be observed if several words come between the two instances of\\nthe repeated word or even if they are written in different styles (“WORK” and\\n“work”). It is believed that the failure to encode the second stimulus occurs because\\nit is not individuated or selected as a distinct event when it rapidly follows the first.\\nInstead, the second occurrence is assimilated to the first, and only one event is regis-\\ntered. The phenomenon of repetition blindness suggests that when we do not have\\nmuch time, we do not form a second, separate representation of an object we have\\njust processed and so are not aware of the repetition.\\n1.1.3. Sources of Limitation\\nWhy do we fail to select information in space or in time? Some have argued that the\\nfailure is on the sensory end; that is, the limitation is, literally, in the eye of the be-\\nholder (or, if the stimuli are auditory, in the ear of the beholder). Human peripheral\\nvision is not very precise, and, in many studies, the information that participants\\nmiss appears at the edges of the screen. But failures to select all the information pres-\\nent cannot be explained solely by the drop-off in visual acuity for information ap-\\npearing farther from the center of the visual field. In the Neisser and Becklen study\\n(with superimposed video sequences), for example, all the necessary information ap-\\npeared in the center of the screen. In the attentional blink and repetition blindness\\nstudies, the information is also presented in the center of the field. In these circum-\\nstances, then, the failure cannot be one of poor vision. Rather, the limitation appears\\nto have to do with the quantity of information. Some models propose the notion of\\na bottleneck ,a  r e s t r i c t i o n  o n  t h e  a m o u n t  o f  i n f o r m a t i o n  t h a t  c a n  b e  p r o c e s s e d  a t\\nonce; because of the bottleneck, certain critical mental operations have to be carried\\nout sequentially (Pashler & Johnston, 1998).\\nDivided-attention studies demonstrate that performance is hampered when you\\nhave to attend to two separate sources of visual information (like the television\\nscreen and the newspaper page) or two separate visual events (the hand-slapping\\ngame and the basketball play). There is also an added cost in accuracy or reaction\\ntime when you attempt to perform two tasks at once. In all these cases, the decre-\\nment in performance is referred to as dual-task interference .\\nOne might wonder whether this decrement occurs because there is too much in-\\nterference when all the information is similar, because it is all visual (or is all uditory)\\nand we simply cannot cope with the quantity of data presented. There is, in fact,\\ngreater interference when the sources are both of the same type of information than\\nwhen they are different (Brooks, 1968). If you are trying to recall a sentence,\\nperforming another verbal task such as counting will impair your performance much\\n112 CHAPTER 3 Attention\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 112 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

By the same\\ntoken, a spatial task such as visualizing a map of the United States and scanning\\nalong its borders, noticing which states are wider than they are tall, would impede\\nrecall of a picture but not of a sentence.\\nBut the limitation is more general, and the failure to select information can occur\\neven if the two sources of information are of two different types, or even if the infor-\\nmation is presented in two different sensory modalities, say, one auditory and one\\nvisual, although the interference is not as great as when the types of information are\\nthe same. Some investigators believe that the extent of the interference depends on\\nthe extent of the “cross-talk” between the various representations and processes\\ndrawn upon by the incoming information: if similar representations and processes are\\nactivated in the two tasks, they may be confused. For example, both recalling a sen-\\ntence and counting engage verbal representations; these representations may infiltrate\\neach other and hinder processing. But recalling a sentence and visualizing a map of\\nthe United States have less overlap of representations and, hence, produce less inter-\\nference with each other. A practical issue in dual tasking is discussed in the accompa-\\nnying Debate box.\\nThe bottlenecks in attention we have looked at so far have all been perceptual:\\ntoo many competing stimuli, or fewer stimuli but of the same type and therefore com-\\npeting. A bottleneck in attention can also occur when, even with a single sensory in-\\nput, the outputs required are too great. In such cases, the bottleneck is motor in\\nnature. Consider this: You’ve just picked up a ringing phone. The only sensory input\\nis the sound of the caller’s voice. The call is not for you. Is your roommate around?\\nYou have to check. The caller’s in a hurry—can you take a message? Sure—where’s\\nthe pad . . . and while you’re looking you’ve missed the beginning of the message.\\nOK—but now the pencil’s dropped . . . gosh, this is taking a long time. . . . One sen-\\nsory stimulus is requiring a number of responses. Coordinating them will be difficult,\\nand some information will be missed, unless you take all the required responses a lit-\\ntle more slowly or in turn. As with multiple sensory inputs, coordinating two output\\nresponses is more difficult than simply making a single response. It is not impossible\\nto do two things at once, and, indeed, we can get better at this with practice, but there\\nis usually some associated cost or failure even when one is skilled.\\nJust as divided-attention failures, in which sensory information is not attended,\\ndo not result from a limitation in vision, the failures in motor output when you try\\nto do a number of things at once or in quick succession do not result from a limita-\\ntion in the ability to program your muscles to move.

Preliminary experiments determined that it took about 500 milliseconds for\\nparticipants to press the foot pedal after the onset of the tone. If the light flashed (re-\\nquiring the left-hand response) 50 milliseconds before the tone sounded, participants\\ntook even longer than the 500 milliseconds to press the pedal. Response selection for\\nthe tone–pedal could not begin until the response selection for the light had been\\ncompleted, accounting for the additional time to press the pedal (Pashler, 1998).\\nThe use of cellular phones has skyrocketed worldwide in the last\\nfew years. Recent surveys have shown that about 85 percent of cell-phone users in the United\\nStates use a cell phone while driving. Redelmeier and Tibshirani (1997) found that cell-phone use\\nwas associated with a fourfold increase in the likelihood of an accident. (Note that, in many states, it is il-\\nlegal to drive and use a handheld phone, which makes sense given the increased risk of accidents when\\ncell phones are used.) What we do not know from this early study is whether the accidents occur more of-\\nten when people are dialing a number, when they are talking, or when they are reaching for the phone; that\\nis, whether there is more dual-task interference in some conditions than in others.\\nMore recent studies try to sort out these possibilities. For example, Strayer and Johnston (2001) de-\\nsigned an experiment in which participants undertook a simulated driving task requiring them to “follow” a\\ntarget car. Participants were assigned randomly to one of three conditions: during the driving task, some\\nparticipants listened to a radio program of their choosing (group 1); others conversed on a cell phone about\\nthe presidential election of 2000 or the Olympic games on either a handheld (group 2) or hands-free\\n(group 3) phone. At irregular intervals, a signal flashed red or green; participants were instructed to press\\na “brake” button when they saw a red signal. The experimenters recorded both the number of times the\\nparticipants missed the red signal and the time it took for the individual to press the brake button.\\nThe results were straightforward: both cell-phone groups missed the red signal twice as many times\\nas did the radio group; and when they did spot the signal, their response (measured by the time to press\\nthe brake button) came later. This lag in response time was more pronounced when the participant was\\ntalking rather than listening. The difference in performance between the radio and cell-phone groups could\\nnot be explained by different levels of driving skills in the two groups; all participants performed the driving\\ntask alone (no cell phone) and there was no difference in performance between the groups in this single-\\ntask condition. It was only the addition of the cell-phone task that led to the different results.\\nIn just what way is attention affected? In a follow-up study, Strayer, Drews, and Johnston (2003)\\nshowed that the consequence of adding the task of conducting a phone conversation to the task of driv-\\ning led the participants to withdraw attention from the visual scene. Participant drivers who held cell-\\nphone conversations missed or had imperfect recall of billboard signs along the route. It turns out that\\nthese drivers did not really look at the information: the eye movements of drivers who were talking on the\\nphone were not drawn to information along the route, even when it was presented in the center of the vi-\\nsual field and, consequently, they had poorer memory for that information. These failures to process and\\nselect information are very similar to those reported in other experiments on failures to select information;\\nin all cases, the participants could not take in all the visual information that is present and, therefore,\\nfocused on only small amounts.\\nCars and Conversation DEBATE\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 114 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

Problems in Interpretation\\nAlthough cognitive psychologists have spent a great deal of time and effort examining\\ndivided attention and the costs associated with dual tasks, many questions remain. For\\none thing, researchers can never guarantee that the two sources of input are always be-\\ning attended simultaneously, or that the two outputs are always being selected simulta-\\nneously, or that the two tasks are always performed simultaneously. Even under\\nconditions in which one task apparently demands constant attention (for example, driv-\\ning), it appears that the same level of attention is not required at every single moment.\\nAn effective strategy for multitasking, then, may be simply to switch quickly back and\\nforth between the two tasks (or inputs or responses) rather than try to deal fully with\\nboth simultaneously. But how do you pick your moments? Listening to the car radio for\\na moment, then watching the road, then listening again is not a very practical (or rec-\\nommended) procedure, no matter how short each alternate period of attention is! We\\nstill do not know whether it is possible to perform two tasks at exactly the same time\\nor, if it is, what burden this arrangement places on the cognitive system.\\nA second problem that has muddied the dual-task waters is that it is not possi-\\nble to guarantee that when you do two things at the same time, you’re doing them in\\nexactly the same way as you would if you were performing each task singly. Several\\nresearchers have suggested that the participants learn to restructure the two tasks\\nand combine them into a single task (Schmidtke & Heuer, 1997; Spelke et al., 1976).\\nIf this is in fact what happens, and the dual tasks morph into a single task, it is dif-\\nficult to separate out and quantify performance on each of the tasks. Also, in this\\nmorphing, each task has in some way been altered to make the combination possi-\\nble, and so comparisons of the cost of dual tasks relative to the single task may not\\nbe legitimate.\\nIn any event, dual tasking may not be impossible, and one can develop immu-\\nnity to its adverse effects by becoming more proficient at one or both tasks. Let’s\\nlook again at the dual task of using a cell phone and driving. Using simulated con-\\nditions, researchers asked drivers to drive normally and, while doing so, to perform\\na secondary task such as changing the radio station or selecting and calling a num-\\nber on a cell phone (Wikman et al., 1998). To perform the secondary task, novice\\ndrivers frequently looked away from the road for more than 3 seconds at a time, a\\nlong (and dangerous) amount of time when you are on the highway. Under the same\\nconditions, experienced drivers glanced away from the road only for brief periods.\\nBecause they were proficient at driving and this skill had become more automatic for\\nthem, the experienced drivers knew how much time they could spend on the sec-\\nondary task without greatly affecting their driving. With enough practice and expe-\\nrience, a task can become more automatic and, as a result, less interference will be\\nobserved when it is performed in conjunction with another task.\\nIn the late 1970s two researchers used just this terminology and described pro-\\ncessing as being either automatic or controlled (Shiffrin & Schneider, 1977). Just as\\nour example of driving experience suggests, they found that people use automatic\\nprocessing on easy or very familiar tasks but are forced to use controlled processing\\nfor difficult or new tasks. However, controlled tasks can also become automatic with\\npractice over time.\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 115 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

When the Brain Fails\\nThe failures of selection described so far are part and parcel of the human experi-\\nence—we have all experienced them at one time or another. This normal pattern of\\nfailures, however, is massively exaggerated in those who suffer from hemispatial\\nneglect ,a  d e f i c i t  o f  a t t e n t i o n  i n  w h i c h  o n e  e n t i r e  h a l f  o f  a  v i s u a l  s c e n e  i s  s i m p l y  i g -\\nnored. The cause of hemispatial neglect is often a stroke that has interrupted the flow\\nof blood to the right parietal lobe, a region of the brain that is thought to be critical\\nin attention and selection (Figure 3–6a on color insert). When these patients are asked\\nto copy or even draw from memory a clock or a daisy (Figure 3–6b on color insert),\\nthey do not attend to (that is, they fail to select) information on the side of space op-\\nposite the lesion and so do not incorporate this information in their pictures. Similarly,\\nwhen they are asked to put a mark through all the lines that they see on a page set be-\\nfore them, their results often show gross disregard of information on the left side: they\\ncancel lines far to the right, as if the left part of the image were simply not there (Figure\\n3–6c on color insert). The reason for failure to select the information on the left (op-\\nposite the lesion) is not that they are blind on that side and fail to see the information.\\nRather, they do not seem to orient toward information on the left side of the scene be-\\nfore them and attend to it. If it is pointed out to them that there is information missing\\non the left side of their drawing, they may then go back and fill in the missing infor-\\nmation; but, left to their own devices, they apparently do not select information from\\nthe left side. The neglect is not restricted to visual information (further demonstrating\\nthat it is not a visual problem per se)—such patients may also ignore sounds or touch\\ndelivered to the left side, or even fail to detect smells delivered to the left nostril.\\nHemispatial neglect can make daily life unpleasant and sometimes dangerous.\\nPatients may eat food from only the right side of the dish, ignoring the food on the\\nleft, and then complain about being hungry. (If the plate is turned around so the re-\\nmaining food is on the right side, the problem is rectified.) They may shave or apply\\nmakeup to only the right half of the face. They may attend to only the right portion\\nof text, reading a newspaper headline\\nSPECTACULAR SUNSHINE REPLACES FLOODS IN SOUTHWEST\\nas\\nFLOODS IN SOUTHWEST\\nand may even neglect the left of some words that appear on the right side too, read-\\ning the title as\\nFLOODS IN SOUTH WEST\\nThey may neglect a left sleeve or slipper, and leave hanging the left earpiece of their\\neyeglasses (Bartolomeo & Chokron, 2001).\\nPeople with hemispatial neglect suffer deficits in their mental imagery as well as\\nin perception. Even when there is no sensory input, and the image is solely created\\nby their own memory, the side opposite the site of damage to the brain is a blank.\\nBisiach and Luzzatti (1978) demonstrated this by asking a group of hospitalized pa-\\ntients with hemispatial neglect, all of them residents of Milan, to describe in detail\\n116 CHAPTER 3 Attention\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 116 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

Because the piazza was not in sight,\\nthis instruction required the patients to generate a mental image of it in order to de-\\nscribe it. Even though the information was being read off entirely from an internal\\nrepresentation and not from sensory input, the patients reported few details on the\\nside of space opposite the damage. This was not the result of memory failure or for-\\ngetting: the experimenters then asked the patients to imagine walking around the pi-\\nazza and viewing it from the side of the piazza opposite their point of view in their\\nfirst mental image. Once again, patients neglected the details on the side of space op-\\nposite their lesion, but now described the buildings and shops they had ignored in\\ntheir first description. The finding that hemispatial neglect patients neglect the left of\\ntheir mental images suggests that attention can operate not only to select information\\nfrom real perceptual input but can also select from a scene that is internally generated.\\nThere are some situations in which left-sided information can capture the attention\\nof the patient with neglect. Very strong and salient information that appears on the neg-\\nlected side of the input may successfully capture the patient’s attention in a bottom-up\\nfashion; a bright light or a sudden sound on the left side may do the trick. Top-down\\nguidance may also be helpful: specifically instructing the patient to attend to the left\\nmay reduce the extent of the neglect, but such guidance must be frequently reiterated.\\nAlthough the most obvious deficit in these patients is a failure to attend to left-\\nsided information in space, there is also evidence that there may be a failure to select\\ninformation in time. For example, Cate and Behrmann (2002) presented letters (such\\nas an “A” or an “S”) briefly (100-millisecond exposures) on the left and right sides of\\na computer screen and asked a patient with left-sided neglect to report which letters\\nappeared. When a letter was presented alone on the left side, the patient identified 88\\npercent of the letters correctly; this percentage was comparable to the 83 percent\\nreported correctly when the letters appeared alone on the intact right side. The inter-\\nesting finding occurred when both letters were presented together. (In some patients, it\\nis under these dual presentation conditions that the deficit for the left emerges most\\nstrongly.) If the letter on the left appeared first and remained on the screen for about\\n300 milliseconds before the appearance of the right letter, it was reported correctly\\nalmost as often as when it appeared alone. When the right letter appeared ahead of the\\nleft letter by 300 milliseconds however, the left letter was correctly reported only about\\n25 percent of the time. If, however, the right letter was presented first but enough time,\\nsay, 900 milliseconds, elapsed before the left letter appeared, the attraction associated\\nwith the right letter apparently decayed and the patient was free to attend to the left\\nletter. In this case, detection went back up to about 80 percent. These results are rem-\\niniscent of those in the attentional blink experiment.\\nThis study makes two important points: (1) When the left letter is on its own\\nand has no competitor to its right, it can survive the neglect; (2) when a competitor\\nis present on the right, the probability of the left letter’s being detected following a\\nshort temporal interval is reduced because the patient is still attending to the more\\nrightward letter. If enough time passes, however, the patient can attend to the left let-\\nter once again (Husain et al., 1997). Because the time also affects the outcome, it\\nsuggests that spatial (left–right) and temporal attentional mechanisms interact in de-\\ntermining how much information is neglected.\\n1.

Yes, but not many. The explanation usually of-\\nfered lies in the greater, and asymmetric, specialization of brain areas in humans. In\\nhumans, the areas involved in processing language are generally in the left hemi-\\nsphere, and attentional and spatial processes may therefore have been shifted into the\\nright hemisphere. In humans, then, damage to the right hemisphere gives rise to neg-\\nlect more often and with greater severity than does damage to the left hemisphere.\\n1.2. Successes of Selection\\nFortunately, the normal attention system is not as dumb as it may appear. Despite\\nthe many failures of selection we are prone to—which may come about because too\\nmuch information is present at any one location, or because too much information\\nstreams rapidly in time, or because our attention is divided—there are many condi-\\ntions under which we can successfully and efficiently select the necessary informa-\\ntion from the input presented to us.\\n1.2.1. Endogenous and Exogenous Effects in Space\\nWhen you were looking for your friend at the party, two kinds of information af-\\nfected your search. One came from within you: your knowledge of the color of her\\ndress. The other came from outside you: the sound of breaking glass. (In this case,\\nknowing the color of dress helped; the glass crash distracted.) These two types of\\nsources of information have been found to be highly effective determiners of what\\ninformation is attended.\\nWhen you came into the room, you searched very broadly and rapidly for all\\ngreen things in the array of colors that surrounded you and then, within this subset of\\ngreen things, specifically for your friend’s dress. This sort of attentional process, which\\nhas a voluntary aspect, is top down; it originates from within (from your own knowl-\\nedge, in this case) and hence is called endogenous attention .B u t  t h i s  f o r m  o f  g o a l -\\ndriven or top-down attention, can be overridden: salient and powerful stimuli can\\ncapture attention and direct you away from the task at hand. Attention thus captured\\nis described as exogenous attention ,b e c a u s e  i t  i s  d r i v e n  i n  a  b o t t o m - u p  f a s h i o n  b y\\nstimuli generated outside oneself. (Like the sound of the breaking glass, strong color\\ncan provide an exogenous cue, and can be very useful: little children on field trips and\\nprisoners in work-release programs wear brightly colored shirts for the same reason.)\\nThe most systematic studies that examine endogenous and exogenous forms\\nof attention are based on the idea of covert attention, which was developed by\\nHermann von Helmholtz (1821–1894), the German physiologist and physicist.\\nVon Helmholtz demonstrated that although the eyes may be directed at a specific spot,\\nvisual attention can be directed elsewhere “covertly,” that is, without overt motion\\nof the eyes. (Helmholtz achieved his experimental conditions by flashing a spark of\\nlight, which, as a highly salient stimulus, prevented physical motion of his eyes\\ntoward the region of space he was attending.)\\nIn modern studies, investigators seek to understand how endogenous and ex-\\nogenous cues influence information processing (Posner et al., 1980, 1982).

The Nature and Roles of Attention 119\\nexperiment, two boxes appear on a computer screen, one to the right and one to the\\nleft of a central fixation point (Figure 3–7a). An endogenous cue such as an arrow\\nleads the participants to focus attention to that location even while their eyes are\\nkept on the fixation point. The arrow is a symbol; only after its meaning is under-\\nstood does a participant know how to shift attention—and hence attention is con-\\ntrolled by endogenous processes. On a large proportion of trials (usually around 80\\npercent), designated as “valid trials,” a target such as a small box is subsequently\\npresented at the cued location and participants press a response key as soon as they\\ndetect the presence of the target. In “invalid trials” an arrow cue appears pointing in\\nthe direction opposite the position of the target. Finally, in other, “neutral,” trials,\\nthe target appears at the same location but the arrow is not informative—it points\\nboth leftward and rightward.\\nThis study produced two main results. First, participants detected the target\\nfaster (and more accurately) in the valid condition compared to a neutral condition,\\nsuggesting that attending to a location can facilitate processing in that location, even\\nin the absence of eye movements. Second, participants detected the target in the in-\\nvalidly cued location significantly more slowly than in the neutral condition (and,\\nobviously, more slowly than in the valid condition). What was happening? The\\nparticipants were deceived or misled by the cue in the “wrong” position, which\\nguided their attention in a top-down, endogenous fashion; the subsequent shifting of\\nattention to the other side of the display cost them time. In normal participants, this\\npattern of costs and benefits is roughly the same whether the target appears on the\\nleft or the right of fixation (Figure 3–7b). Data from patients with hemispheric\\nneglect show a very different pattern (see Figure 3–7b).\\nAttention is also facilitated by a valid cue and inhibited by an invalid cue when\\nthe cue is exogenous. An example: this time two boxes are on the screen and one\\nbrightens momentarily, presenting a salient bottom-up cue. The target (e.g., a small\\nwhite box as in Figure 3–7a) then appears in either the cued or the noncued box; in\\nthe neutral condition, both boxes brighten. Attention is automatically drawn to the\\nside of the display with the salient bright box. As with endogenous cuing, the par-\\nticipants detect the target faster when it appears in the location indicated by the cue\\n(the valid condition) and detect it more slowly in the invalid condition.\\nAlthough the pattern of findings is very similar in the endogenous and exoge-\\nnous cases, there is one difference. In the exogenous version, attention can be rapidly\\nand automatically drawn toward the powerfully salient brightening cue and no ex-\\ntra processing time is needed. But exploiting the arrow cue in the endogenous ver-\\nsion requires that participants process the cue perceptually, understand its content,\\nand then use this information in a top-down fashion. If the arrow appears and the\\ntarget follows immediately thereafter, participants show neither the benefit nor the\\ncost of the presence of the cue. Given enough time (perhaps 150 milliseconds) to\\nprocess and implement the information provided by the cue, the facilitation and\\ninhibition emerge clearly.\\nThese studies amply demonstrate that facilitation and inhibition of detection are\\ninfluenced by the direction of attention alone, without overt eye movement. More\\nrecent results suggest that although it is possible under experimental conditions\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 119 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

The Nature and Roles of Attention 121\\n(such as those described here) to dissociate covert attention and eye movements, un-\\nder more natural circumstances, the two are tightly linked and may even rely on the\\nsame underlying network in the brain (Corbetta & Shulman, 2002). In fact, some re-\\nsearchers have suggested that the coupling of attention and eye movements is partic-\\nularly advantageous: attention can scout the visual scene first and then the eyes can\\nbe moved to regions containing particularly useful or salient information (Hoffman\\n& Subramaniam, 1995).\\n1.2.2. Components of Attention\\nWhat happens when patients with hemispatial neglect perform this attentional cueing\\ntask? Patients with lesions to the right parietal lobe, many of whom also suffered\\nhemispatial neglect, detected the valid targets normally on the nonneglected right side\\nand almost normally on the neglected left side (Posner et al., 1984, 1987). That is, they\\ncould still take advantage of the cue even though their performance was a little poorer\\nwhen the target appeared on the neglected side, and this was true whether the cue was\\nendogenous or exogenous. In the invalid trials, when the cue occurred on or pointed\\nto the neglected left side but the target appeared on the nonneglected right side, these\\npatients detected the target more slowly than in the valid trials. The extent of the slow-\\ning, however, was in the normal range; neurologically healthy participants, as we have\\nseen, also showed a cost in the reaction time in invalid trials. The important result is\\nthat in those invalid trials in which the cue occurred on (or pointed to) the non-\\nneglected right side and the target appeared on the neglected left side, the patients with\\nbrain damage needed roughly an additional 500 milliseconds to detect the target.\\nThe findings from patients with brain damage led Posner and colleagues to con-\\nstruct a model for attention that involves three separate mental operations: disen-\\ngaging of attention from the current location; moving attention to a new location;\\nand engaging attention in a new location to facilitate processing in that location\\n(Posner, 1990; Posner & Cohen, 1984). In the case of the right-hemisphere patients,\\nthe model suggests that when the cue directed attention to the nonneglected right\\nside and the target appeared on the neglected left side, the patients had trouble dis-\\nengaging attention from the good right side, and this deficit produced the dramati-\\ncally slower target-detection times. No “disengage” problem was apparent for targets\\non the nonneglected side when the preceding cue indicated the neglected side. In this\\nmodel then, there are several subcomponents of attention, and results indicate that\\nthe parietal lobe (especially on the right) plays a key role in one of them.\\nInterestingly, Posner and colleagues found other patient groups who appeared to\\nbe impaired in either the “move” or “engage” operations posited by their attention\\nmodel. Patients with damage to the midbrain and suffering from a disorder called\\nprogressive supranuclear palsy seemed to have no difficulty with “disengage” or\\n“engage” operations (Posner et al., 1985). Rather, they were slow in responding to\\ncued targets in the direction in which they had difficulty orienting, suggesting a\\nproblem in moving attention to the cued location. On the other hand, patients with\\nlesions to the pulvinar, a part of the thalamus (a subcortical structure), were slow to\\ndetect both validly and invalidly cued targets that appeared on the side of space op-\\nposite their lesion, but performed well when the targets appeared on the intact side\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 121 REVISED PAGES'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Attention.pdf', 'page': 19}, page_content='122 CHAPTER 3 Attention\\n(Rafal & Posner, 1987). These results led the researchers to suggest that the thalamic\\npatients cannot engage attention on the affected side. The different patterns of per-\\nformance revealed by these three patient groups support the idea that attention can\\nbe decomposed into three separate functions (disengage–move–engage) and that\\neach can be selectively affected depending on which brain structures are damaged\\n(for an overview, see Robertson & Rafal, 2000).\\n1.2.3. Cross-Modal Links\\nAlthough many studies have focused on attentional effects in vision, there is also\\nevidence that facilitatory and inhibitory effects can be found within and across dif-\\nferent sensory modalities. Once you spotted your friend at the party visually, you\\nsuddenly heard her calling your name, but it was likely she’d been calling you for\\nsome time. Why did seeing her make her voice more audible?\\nA series of experiments has demonstrated cross-modal priming under both ex-\\nogenous and endogenous conditions (Driver & Spence, 1998; Kennett et al., 2002).\\n(As noted in Chapter 2, priming occurs when a stimulus or task facilitates process-\\ning of a subsequent stimulus or task.) In one experimental design, participants held\\ntactile stimulators that could vibrate at either the thumb or index finger in each\\nhand. Four light-emitting diodes were placed in corresponding locations in space.\\nWhen participants were asked to report the location of the tactile stimulus, the pres-\\nence of a noninformative visual flash on the same side of space speeded responses.\\nThe reverse condition was also true: a random tactile stimulus primed responses to\\nvisual targets on the same side. When participants crossed their hands, the priming\\nwas found to be aligned with external space (that is, the left hand crossed to the right\\nside of the body primed detection of a visual stimulus on the right). These effects\\nhave also been found between audition and touch, and between audition and vision.\\nSimilar cueing effects have been found when participants expect a stimulus in a\\nlocation in one modality and an unexpected stimulus appears on the same side of\\nspace in a different modality. For example, when expecting a visual stimulus on the\\nright, participants are quicker to detect a random tactile event on that side of space\\nthan one on the left. This finding suggests that directing attention to one side of\\nspace in one modality automatically results in attention to that location for other\\nmodalities as well.\\n1.2.4. Object-Based Attention\\nIn life, we are surrounded by objects, animate and inanimate, of all sorts, and attention is\\ndirected toward them as well as to locations in space and positions in temporal sequence.\\nRecent studies of object-based attention show that when attention is directed toward an\\nobject, all the parts of that object are simultaneously selected for processing (e.g., Jaomasz\\net al., 2005). An immediate example: you think of your friend in green as a single object\\n(and no doubt, because she’s a friend, as greater than the sum of her parts). As you focus\\non her, you would be more likely to notice the watch on her wrist, because it is a part of\\nher, than to notice the watch worn by the person standing next to her, even if that person\\nis standing just as close to you as she is—that watch is a part of a different object.\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/13/06  8:45 AM  Page 122 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

The Nature and Roles of Attention 123\\nMany studies of object-based attention demonstrate that an object and its asso-\\nciated parts and features are selected together. In one of the best-known studies\\n(Duncan, 1984), participants saw in the center of a computer screen a rectangular\\nbox with a gap in one side and a line through the box (Figure 3–8). When they were\\ninstructed to respond with two judgments about a single object—whether the box\\nwas big or small in relation to the frame of the screen and whether the gap was on\\nthe left or right side—accuracy of report was high. In fact, participants were almost\\nas good at reporting on the two features as when they were required to make only a\\nsingle judgment, on box size or gap side. Similar results were obtained when partic-\\nipants were asked to make the two judgments about the line itself—was it slanted or\\nupright, was it dashed or dotted? In a further condition, the two judgments the par-\\nticipants were asked to make concerned the box and the line, for example, the size\\nof the box and the texture of the line. This time, although again no more than two\\njudgments were required, accuracy fell significantly.\\nThe important aspect of this study is that both objects—box and line—were super-\\nimposed one on the other in the center of the screen, thus occupying the same spatial lo-\\ncation. The results with one object (box or line) and two objects (box and line) cannot\\nbe explained by preferential attention to a particular location in space. Instead, the re-\\nsult is compatible with the idea of object-based attention. Apparently, our perceptual\\nsystem can handle two judgments quite well when attention is focused on a single ob-\\nject. When attention must be divided across two different objects, however, making two\\njudgments becomes very difficult and performance suffers badly (this is similar to the\\ncost that occurs under dual-task conditions). These findings support the idea that at-\\ntention can be directed to a single object and all features of the object attended.\\nNeuroimaging has confirmed these behavioral results: when we attend to one\\naspect of an object, we perforce select the entire object and all its features\\n(O’Craven et al., 1999). Participants were shown pictures of a semitransparent face\\nsuperimposed on a semitransparent house and instructed to fixate on the dot in the\\ncenter of the superimposed images (Figure 3–9).

If attention were directed toward a spatial location, then we might have\\nexpected to see activation in all three brain regions, corresponding to the three stim-\\nulus types, given that all three occurred in the same region of space. If, however, se-\\nlectively attending to one attribute of an object also enhances processing of other\\nattributes of the same object, then we would expect greater activation in the brain\\narea representing co-occurring attributes of the selected object. And, indeed, that\\nwas the case. When motion was selectively attended, not only was MT activated, as\\nexpected, but the area representing the attended object (face or house) was also ac-\\ntivated. Thus, for example, the fusiform gyrus face area was activated when the face\\nwas moving compared to when it was static, even though the face itself was not\\npreferentially attended. The same was true for the parahippocampal place area\\nwhen the house moved. This suggests that in object attention, more than one fea-\\nture is simultaneously selected (say, house-and-moving or face-and-moving) and the\\ncorresponding neural areas reflect this coactivation.\\nEvidence from brain damage also supports the notion of object-based attention.\\nAlthough hemispatial neglect is predominantly thought of as a deficit in processing\\nin which attention to the left side of space after a right-hemisphere lesion is demon-\\nstrably poor, it has been shown that the left side of individual objects is also\\nneglected. In one study with neglect patients (Behrmann & Tipper, 1994; Tipper &\\nBehrmann, 1996), participants were shown a static schematic image of a barbell,\\nwith each end a different color (Figure 3–10). Participants were instructed to press a\\nkey when they detected a small white flashing light in either the left or right end of\\nthe barbell. As expected of patients with left-sided neglect, detection on the left was\\npoorer than on the right. But was this because the target appeared on the left of\\nspace (space-based neglect) or because the target appeared on the left of the object\\n(object-based neglect)?\\nIn a second condition, while participants watched, the barbell rotated so that the\\noriginal left end (as identified by its color) appeared on the right of space and the\\nright end of the barbell appeared on the left of space. Surprisingly, when the target—\\nthe flashing light—appeared on participants’ “good” side, the right of space (but in\\nthe end of the barbell that had previously appeared on the left), participants took\\nlonger to detect its presence. The poorer detection in the rotating case occurred pre-\\nsumably because the target fell on what had been the left end of the barbell. Simi-\\nlarly, when the target appeared on the left of space, performance was better than in\\nthe static condition, because it now fell on the right end of the object. A further, and\\nimportant, finding was that when the two circles that depicted the ends of the bar-\\nbell were not joined by a connecting bar, participants’ detection of targets on the\\nright of space was always good and detection of targets on the left of space was al-\\nways poor. In other words, no object-based neglect occurred, presumably because\\nthe two circles were not perceived as two ends of a single object; therefore, only\\nspace- and not object-based attention operated.\\nAn even more extreme case of object-based selection—or rather its deficit—can be\\nseen in patients with Bálint’s syndrome (for more information about this syndrome,\\nsee Rafal, 2001). This neurological disorder follows after bilateral (that is, on both\\nsides of the brain) damage to the parietal-occipital region; it is sometimes referred to\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 125 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

These patients are able to perceive only one\\nobject at a time; it is as if one object captures attention and precludes processing of\\nany others.\\nHowever, the failure to select more than one object can be reduced if the objects\\nare grouped perceptually. In one such study (Figure 3–11), Humphreys and Riddoch\\n(1993) had two patients with simultanagnosia view a display containing colored cir-\\ncles (each itself an object). On some trials, the circles were all the same color and on\\nother trials half the circles were one color, half another. The patients were to report\\nwhether the circles in a display were all the same color or were of two different col-\\nors. In some displays, the circles were unconnected (the random condition); in oth-\\ners, circles of the same color were connected by lines, and in still others (the single\\ncondition), circles of different colors were connected (the mixed condition). In dis-\\nplays of unconnected circles, the patients found it difficult to judge color, especially\\nwhen there were two circles of different color—there were just too many different\\nobjects. If, however, the two differently colored circles formed a single object by\\nvirtue of a connecting line, some of the difficulty of attending to each circle sepa-\\nrately was offset, and the patients did better in the mixed condition than in the other\\ntwo conditions. The cost of dividing attention between differently colored circles\\nwas reduced when these circles were joined to make a single object, and this im-\\nprovement was more dramatic than in either the random or single condition.\\nFIGURE 3–11 Simultanagnosia\\nPatients with simultanagnosia can attend to only a single object at a time; these patients can be\\nhelped when information in the visual scene is bound together to make a single object.

Selection of information can fail when too much information is present at any\\none time or when information comes in faster than we can process it. What are\\nsome examples of failures in space and in time?\\n2. What are the distinctions between exogenous and endogenous forms of atten-\\ntion?\\n2. EXPLAINING ATTENTION: INFORMATION-PROCESSING \\nTHEORIES\\n“Paying attention” encompasses dynamic processes that involve the enhancement or\\nselection of particular information and the inhibition of other information. Atten-\\ntion may be thought of as a mechanism that controls processing so that we are not\\noverwhelmed by too much information. Endogenous factors such as one’s knowl-\\nedge and goals and exogenous factors such as the salience of external information\\ncan influence the selection. But how does attention work? A number of different\\ninformation-processing theories have attempted to capture the dynamics of atten-\\ntional effects. Although none of these theories can explain all the attentional phe-\\nnomena we have described so far, the theories offer important insights into the\\nprinciples that underlie attentional effects.\\n2.1. Early versus Late Attentional Selection\\nAlmost all the experiments described here show that we can attend only to some of\\nthe sensory information that surrounds us and not to all of it. In the language of in-\\nformation processing, this selective aspect of attention is often a consequence of in-\\nadequate channel capacity or a fundamental limitation in the flow of information.\\nOne question is, when does selection occur, early or late in processing? Where is the\\nbottleneck? How much and what kind of information is processed before it, how\\nmuch and what kind after it? That essentially is the problem of “early versus late\\nattentional selection.”\\nThe British psychologist Donald Broadbent (1926–1993) favored the view that\\nselection is made at an early stage of processing. He proposed a model of the atten-\\ntional system as containing a limited-capacity channel through which only a certain\\namount of information could pass (Broadbent, 1958). The many sensory inputs ca-\\npable of entering later phases of processing, he believed, had to be screened to let\\nonly the most important information through. In his view, at an early stage of pro-\\ncessing, information comes into a very brief sensory store in which physical charac-\\nteristics of the input are analyzed: in the visual modality, these characteristics are\\nmotion, color, shape, spatial location; in the auditory modality, pitch, loudness, and,\\nagain, spatial location. Broadbent argued that the bottleneck is immediately after the\\nsensory store, and only a small amount of information, selected on the basis of phys-\\nical characteristics, passes through for further, semantic processing.\\n/checkbld\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 128 REVISED PAGES'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Attention.pdf', 'page': 26}, page_content='2. Explaining Attention: Behaviorally Based Theories 129\\nBroadbent’s ideas were well received at the time; they successfully accounted for\\na range of empirical evidence. Some of this evidence had been presented by E. Colin\\nCherry (1953), another British psychologist, who recruited volunteers to participate\\nin an auditory experiment. Using a technique called dichotic listening (the literal\\nmeaning is listening with “two ears”), he played competing speech inputs through\\nheadphones to the two ears of his participants. For example, the right ear might\\nreceive “the steamboat chugged into the harbor” while the left ear simultaneously\\nreceived “the schoolyard was filled with children.” Cherry instructed participants to\\n“shadow,” that is, to follow and repeat as rapidly as possible one stream of speech\\ninput and to ignore the other. Cherry found that participants had no memory of\\nwhat was played in the unattended ear; in fact, they did not even notice if the unat-\\ntended message switched to another language or if the message was played back-\\nward. They did, however, notice whether the sex of the speaker was different or\\nwhether the speech became a pure tone.\\nCherry’s results (1953) are consistent with the early-selection bottleneck theory:\\nunattended inputs are filtered out and attended signals are admitted through on the\\nbasis of their physical characteristics. Changes in the physical aspects of a stimulus\\nwere attended, but if there were no such changes, the stimulus would either be at-\\ntended or filtered out. Consistent with the claim that unattended stimuli are filtered,\\nwhen the same word list was played to the unattended ear of participants 35 times\\n(Moray, 1959), the participants never noticed. The failure to detect the repeated\\nword lists indicates that the unattended signals were not processed deeply and the\\nparticipants did not have a representation of the words or their meaning.\\nBut one important piece of evidence suggests that a theory of early selection can-\\nnot be the whole story. Only a theory of late selection—which holds that, before the\\nbottleneck, all information is processed perceptually to determine both physical\\ncharacteristics and semantic content—could account for the finding that some infor-\\nmation could be detected in the unattended channel even when there was no change\\nin its physical features. This was especially true if the information was salient and\\nimportant to the participant. Hearing your friend call your name above the din of\\nthe party is a good example of how unattended but high-priority information can\\nstill be detected. Hearing your name at a loud party is such a good example of this\\nphenomenon that it’s known as the cocktail party effect . By early-selection views, the\\ncocktail party effect should not be possible; but there it is. Because it now seemed\\nthat unattended inputs were able to intrude and capture attention, Broadbent’s ideas\\nhad to be modified.\\nAdditional evidence to support late selection came from a number of studies us-\\ning dichotic listening. In one (Treisman, 1960), a different message was played into\\neach ear of participants. The logical content of each, however, was confused: the\\nleft ear heard “If you are creaming butter and piccolos, clarinets, and tubas seldom\\nplay solos ”; the right ear heard “Many orchestral instruments, such as sugar, it’s a\\ngood idea to use a low mixer speed. ” Participants were told to shadow the right ear,\\nbut some must have switched channels to follow meaning: they reported a reason-\\nable sentence about an orchestra, and believed they had shadowed the correct ear\\nall along.\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 129 REVISED PAGES'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Attention.pdf', 'page': 27}, page_content='130 CHAPTER 3 Attention\\nThe late-selection idea was also tested by presenting a participant’s own name\\non the unattended channel, a controlled equivalent of the cocktail party effect\\n(Wood & Cowan, 1995). About one-third of the participants reported hearing their\\nown name (and none reported hearing a different name). This finding is difficult to\\naccommodate within the early-selection view; it is also difficult to accommodate it\\nentirely within the late-selection view, because only one-third of the participants de-\\ntected their names on the unattended channel. One possible explanation is that this\\none-third occasionally switched attention to the unattended channel. This may in-\\ndeed be what happened: when Wood and Cowan instructed participants ahead of\\ntime to be ready for new instructions during the task, 80 percent of the participants\\nnow heard their name on the unattended channel. This finding undermines late\\nselection and suggests that participants may, for one reason or another, switch\\nattention to the other channel despite instructions.\\nHow can we reconcile these various results? One suggestion is that some kind of\\nanalysis must be done before the bottleneck, or filter, so that one’s own name or\\nother salient information can pass through (Moray, 1970). Arguing against this, an-\\nother suggestion holds that the early-selection view requires only a slight modifica-\\ntion (Treisman, 1969): that in each person’s “dictionary,” or lexical store, some\\nwords have lower thresholds of activation than others. Thus, information is still fil-\\ntered out early, but words that are well known by the listener are more easily de-\\ntected and require less analysis—and hence the information that does get through\\nthe filter is sufficient. Thus, one’s own name or a shouted “Fire!” would appear to\\npass through the bottleneck and capture the listener’s attention. Also, words that are\\nhighly probable given the semantic context (such as piccolo following shortly after\\ninstruments ) may also pass through to our awareness.\\n2.2. Spotlight Theory\\nLike a spotlight that highlights information within its beam, in this view, spatial at-\\ntention selectively brings information within a circumscribed region of space to\\nawareness, and information outside that region is more likely to be ignored. This\\nmetaphor works—up to a point.\\nConsistent with the idea that spatial locations can be enhanced when they fall in\\nand around the spotlight, participants who correctly named letters appearing at mul-\\ntiple locations in the visual field were more likely to succeed at an orientation dis-\\ncrimination task when the forms to be discriminated appeared near the letters. These\\ndata (Hoffman & Nelson, 1981) suggest that information is enhanced when it ap-\\npears near the current position of the spotlight.\\nBut the spotlight metaphor breaks down. For one thing, a number of experiments,\\ndiscussed earlier, have shown that attention can be directed to a single object, even if su-\\nperimposed on another object, demolishing the idea that a “spotlight” of attention\\nhighlights information in a particular spatial region. If that were true, all objects would\\nbe selected together, but we know that one object can be preferentially selected. Another\\ndifficulty is the assumption of the spotlight model that the beam of attention sweeps\\nthrough space. If that’s what happens, one would expect that if an obstacle intervened\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 130 REVISED PAGES'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Attention.pdf', 'page': 28}, page_content='2. Explaining Attention: Behaviorally Based Theories 131\\nin the course of the sweep, attention would be captured or hampered by this obstacle.\\nBut it isn’t. In a study that investigated this expectation (Sperling & Weichselgartner,\\n1995), participants monitored a stream of digits appearing at a fixation point. At the\\nsame time, they were to attend to a rapidly changing stream of letters appearing to the\\nleft of the fixation point and to report any appearance of the letter “C.” Occasionally\\nanother character appeared between the fixation stream and the letters on the left—that\\nis, it interfered with any “spotlight beam.” But this “interference” made no difference:\\nwhether or not intervening information appeared, the time taken to detect a letter “C”\\nwas constant. These results suggest that attention is not influenced by the presence of\\nspatially intervening information, as would be expected from a spotlight model.\\nRather than thinking about attention as a spotlight where information outside the\\nselected region is simply ignored, more recent studies have begun to characterize atten-\\ntion as a dynamic process in which information selection is automatically accompanied\\nby active inhibition of other information. Thus, rather than as a spotlight, attention can\\nbe understood as a competitive system in which tuning into one thing results in the in-\\nhibition of competing information. Attending to green things will result in inhibition of\\nthings of other colors (helping you find your friend on our party example), attending to\\na single object such as a person will result in inhibition of other people or objects, at-\\ntending closely to music may inhibit to some degree unrelated visual information.\\nAttention, then, is a dynamic push–pull process that involves both increasing and de-\\ncreasing the likelihood that certain locations or objects will be processed in detail. These\\nideas are elaborated in greater detail in the final section of this chapter.\\n2.3. Feature Integration Theory and Guided Search\\nThis theory, which has a very different emphasis from ideas of bottlenecks, filters,\\nand spotlights, is mostly concerned with the role attention plays in selecting and\\nbinding complex information. This question has been particularly well investigated\\nin experiments using a visual search task. In this design, a display is presented on a\\ncomputer screen; participants are instructed to find a target piece of information\\nand press a response key when they do. For example, participants may be in-\\nstructed to search for the circle in a display such as that shown in Figure 3–12a.

Try it: the difference between these two types\\nof trials will be immediately apparent. It is absurdly easy to locate the target on the\\nleft, but the display on the right poses more difficulty. Displays like that on the left\\nare referred to as disjunctive (or feature ) search trials. In these trials the target dif-\\nfers from the other characters or symbols—the distractors—by a single feature,\\nsuch as shape (circle among squares). A distractor is a nonrelevant stimulus that is\\nsupposed to be ignored. Displays such as the one in Figure 3–12b are conjunctive\\nsearch trials, in which the target is defined by a conjunction of features—her e, (blue\\nversus white) and shape (circle versus square).\\nYour experience with Figure 3–12 no doubt suggested that disjunctive search is\\ngenerally easier; you’re right. Even increasing the number of elements in the display\\nin disjunctive search does not slow down target detection—the search can be done\\neffortlessly and rapidly. The target seems to pop out at you; this kind of search is\\ndescribed as preattentive; that is, it takes place before attention is engaged. Because\\nthe target pops out regardless of the number of elements in the display, it is likely\\nthat the search is conducted in parallel across the display; that is, all elements are\\nevaluated at the same time. In conjunctive search, however, each element must be\\nattended and evaluated individually to determine whether or not it is the target.\\nAdding more elements to conjunctive search slows you down substantially and, in\\nfact, an additional increment of time is required to detect the target for each addi-\\ntional item included in the display. Because you must examine each item serially to\\nsee whether it has the requisite conjunction of attributes, the time to find the target\\nincreases dramatically as the number of distractors increases.\\nThe cognitive difference between disjunctive and conjunctive search is well\\ncaptured by feature integration theory (FIT) (Treisman & Gelade, 1980). Accord-\\ning to FIT, the perceptual system is divided into separate maps, each of which reg-\\nisters the presence of a different visual feature: color, edges, shapes. Each map\\ncontains information about the location of the features it represents. Thus, the\\nshape map of the display in Figure 3–12a would contain information about some-\\nthing of a particular shape at the right of the screen. If you know that you are look-\\ning for a target defined by that shape, you need only refer to the shape map, which\\ncontains all the shapes present in the display. The shape you are looking for will\\npop out of this shape map and target detection proceeds apace, irrespective of the\\nnumber of distractors of another shape. Looking for a conjunctive target, however,\\nrequires the joint consultation of two maps, the shape map and the color map. FIT\\nsuggests that attention is required to compare the content of the two maps and\\nserves as a kind of glue to bind the unlinked features of, say, “COLORness” [blue]\\nand “circleness” to yield a [blue] circle.\\nFeature integration theory has illuminated other aspects of the way attention\\noperates in visual search. One important finding is that you can search faster for the\\npresence of a feature than for its absence; participants are able to find the “Q”\\n(essentially a circle with a tail) among the “O”s in Figure 3–13a much faster than the\\n“O” (essentially a circle without a tail) among the “Q”s in Figure 3–13b. In fact,\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 132 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

For example, participants sometimes make illusory\\nconjunctions ,t h a t  i s ,  i n c o r r e c t  c o m b i n a t i o n s  o f  f e a t u r e s .

This response, incorrectly\\ncombining features (COLORness and squareness) present in the display, suggests\\nthat these features are registered separately but that they are not properly bound to-\\ngether. When attention is overloaded or the features are not selected together, the iso-\\nlated features remain unbound and may be incorrectly attached to other features\\n(Treisman & Schmidt, 1982).\\nDo brain studies support the distinction between disjunctive and conjunctive\\nprocesses? Some neuroimaging studies have indicated that different types of features\\nreally are being registered by partially distinct neural mechanisms, as assumed by\\nfeature integration theory. But the evidence is not incontrovertible, and some find-\\nings from patients with hemispatial neglect present a challenge to FIT. Patients with\\nhemispatial neglect fail to take into account information on the side of space oppo-\\nsite the lesion, and the deficit has been assumed to be one of failing to attend to that\\nside. According to FIT, disjunctive search is preattentive and does not engage atten-\\ntion, whereas conjunctive search does involve attention. If this distinction is correct,\\nthen one might predict that neglect patients would be able to perform disjunctive\\nsearch well, even when the target appears on the neglected side. The findings suggest\\nthat this is not true. Behrmann and colleagues (2003) tested the visual search per-\\nformance of a large group of neglect patients on the “Q”s and “O”s search task, ma-\\nnipulating the number of elements in the display from 1 to 16 items. As expected,\\nthese patients took a very long time, compared with control participants, to detect\\nthe presence of the “O” among the “Q”s on the right side (remember, this is the\\nmore difficult search, for the absence of a feature).

LOOKING TO THE BRAIN\\nThe study of attention has become a very hot topic in the twenty-first century be-\\ncause of a number of very successful studies of the neural basis of attention. These\\nin turn have furthered our knowledge of the mechanisms that give rise to atten-\\ntion. For example, it is now a well established behavioral finding that when at-\\ntention is directed to a location, perception of that information is enhanced. Until\\nfairly recently, however, we did not know whether this was because the target at\\nthe cued location was more efficiently processed in the visual areas of the brain or\\nbecause the motor system was biased to produce faster responses. Both these ex-\\nplanations are reasonable accounts of the findings of faster target detection. To\\nexplore further, researchers have conducted attention studies with animals and\\nhumans using various biological methods.\\n134 CHAPTER 3 Attention\\n/checkbld\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/13/06  8:45 AM  Page 134 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

Electrophysiology and Human Attention\\nIn the late 1960s, technology was developed that allowed researchers to measure\\nwith considerable precision the variation in electrical activity generated by the\\nbrain. Although it was known that faint waves are emitted by the brain in response\\nto a stimulus, it had not previously been possible to average these tiny signals and\\nrelate them specifically to the processing of that stimulus. More sensitive electrodes\\nplaced on the scalp and more powerful computers to make the calculations could\\ndo the job. With technological advances, it became possible to distinguish between\\nan event-related potential (ERP)—the change in electrical activity in response to a\\nstimulus—and the sorts of brain activity that go on all the time. Investigators were\\nnow able to explore the neural mechanisms associated with various cognitive\\nprocesses, including the phenomenon of selective attention.\\nThe major result from some of these ERP studies was that directing attention to-\\nward a stimulus results in an increase in the amplitude of the waveform as early as\\n70 to 90 milliseconds after the onset of the stimulus. These changes are recorded in\\nthe first positive, or P1, wave over lateral occipital regions of the scalp (in the visual\\nsystem) and suggest that attention enhances the early processing of visual stimuli in\\nthe brain, which leads to better perceptual detection of the attended target stimulus.\\nFor example, a study that recorded ERPs during tasks involving covert attentional\\ncueing (such as that depicted in Figure 3–7) found a difference in the P1 waveform\\n(and also in the first negative wave, N1) between cued and uncued trials for targets\\nin both the left and right visual fields. Larger sensory ERPs were recorded in early\\nstages of visual processing when the targets were in cued locations (Mangun &\\nHillyard, 1991). Attending to a location apparently increased the amount of visual\\nprocessing, giving rise to a larger ERP signal. A similar increase in the sensory ERP\\noccurs when attention is exogenously drawn to a location if the target appears\\nwithin 300 milliseconds of the exogenous cue. Again, an early occipital wave is en-\\nhanced, consistent with enhanced visual processing of the target.\\nTaken together, these results suggest that exogenous, automatic attention and\\nendogenous, voluntary attention (in other words, bottom-up and top-down forms of\\nattention) have at least some underlying processes in common, an implication con-\\nsistent with the behavioral findings discussed earlier. Furthermore, the enlargement\\nof early waveforms at the occipital cortex is consistent with the idea that selection\\noccurs early in the processing stream and that incoming sensory signals may be en-\\nhanced early as a result of attention. But, as we will see, some attentional processing\\nmay also occur later.\\nInterestingly, just as cross-modal links confer benefits in behavioral tasks, inter-\\nactions between different primary sensory areas revealed by ERP studies have simi-\\nlar effects. For example, paying attention to either an auditory or a tactile stimulus\\nappearing on one side of space resulted in enhanced ERPs within the first 200 mil-\\nliseconds at electrodes in primary visual areas. Thus, attending to one side of space\\nin the tactile or the auditory domain automatically resulted in enhanced attention to\\nvisual information on that side. This result indicates that when a salient event takes\\nplace at a given location in one modality, spatial attention is directed to that location\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 135 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

This seems to\\nbe a very efficient way of wiring up the attentional system, and the result at a\\ncrowded party is that when you spot your friend visually, you are better able to hear\\nand localize the sound of your own name.\\n3.2. Functional Neuroimaging and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation\\nData from ERP studies have been very useful in demonstrating that some atten-\\ntional modulation occurs during the first phases of cortical processing, and in\\nshowing similarities across endogenous and exogenous cueing and across visual,\\nauditory, and tactile domains. These data have been able to do this because of the\\ntemporal precision of the ERP technique, allowing measurement of changes in\\nbrain waves over time even down to a matter of milliseconds. But ERP methods\\nare not that good at indicating exactly which region of the brain is responsible for\\ngenerating the brain waves. Because the electrodes are placed on the head and the\\npotentials are recorded at the surface of the scalp, we can never be perfectly sure\\nof the location of the brain region producing the potentials. Functional neu-\\nroimaging serves as a good complementary approach: its temporal precision is\\nnot as good as that achieved by ERP methods, but its spatial precision is far bet-\\nter. The two main functional neuroimaging methods, positron emission tomogra-\\nphy (PET) and fMRI, measure blood flow or metabolism in very particular\\nregions of the brain. Their use in attention studies can demonstrate the regional\\nconsequences of attending to a stimulus. (For a fuller discussion of methodologi-\\ncal issues, see Chapter 1, Section 4.)\\nIn one of the early PET studies, participants were required to shift attention be-\\ntween locations—in this case, boxes aligned horizontally across the visual field—and\\nto press a button when a target appeared in one or the other of the boxes (Corbetta,\\net al., 1993). The experimenters found that the superior (i.e., upper) parietal lobe in\\nthe right hemisphere was consistently activated during attentional shifts compared\\nto periods when fixation was maintained in the middle of the screen (Corbetta et al.,\\n1993; Vandenberghe et al., 2001). The involvement of the superior parietal lobe was\\nalso evident in another visual search study, especially when the target contained a\\nconjunction of features. Although other regions of the brain, including the basal gan-\\nglia, thalamus, insular cortex, frontal cortex, and the anterior cingulate, also show\\nenhanced activation during attentional switching in visual search tasks, the parietal\\nlobe seems to play the primary role.\\nAnother experimental design used PET to monitor brain activation as partici-\\npants inspected an image for a change in either its color, motion, or shape (Corbetta\\net al., 1990). In addition to the parietal cortex, brain areas associated with process-\\ning motion were activated when participants attended to motion. Similarly, when\\nparticipants attended to color, brain areas associated with color were activated. The\\nimportance of this correspondence is the demonstration that while the parietal\\ncortex plays an important role, it is intimately linked with other brain areas that\\nreflect the attentional modulation of the relevant features of a display.\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 136 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

Looking to the Brain 137\\nThe studies of attention have become increasingly sophisticated, and there have\\nbeen attempts to differentiate the neural processes associated with different forms of\\nattention. For example, Corbetta and Shulman (2002) showed that different neural\\nsystems are used when attention is directed to a location before the appearance of a\\nstimulus (an endogenous condition) and when an unexpected salient stimulus appears\\n(an exogenous condition) and redirects a participant’s attention. They found that in\\ncases of endogenous attentional orientation, a network of frontal and dorsal parietal\\nareas (including the intraparietal sulcus, IPS; superior parietal lobule, SPL; and the\\nfrontal eye fields, FEF) was involved. Searching for your friend in a crowded room in-\\nvolved voluntary reorientation of attention that would activate this frontoparietal net-\\nwork of brain areas. On the other hand, effects involving exogenous mechanisms of\\nattention, such as those arising from the harsh sound of shattering glass, were found\\nto activate a more ventral system that included the temporal parietal junction (TPJ)\\nand ventral frontal cortex. The authors hypothesized that this latter system is involved\\nin the detection of unexpected salient or novel information. The two systems were de-\\nscribed as functionally independent but interactive (Figure  3–14).

Conversely, information about the importance of the\\nstimulus from the voluntary system may modulate the sensitivity of the ventral system,\\nproviding a top-down way for your intentions or goals to influence how strongly your\\nattentional system will be distracted by exogenous information.\\nThe notion that attention operates over time as well as over space—for which there\\nis behavioral evidence from studies on attentional blink and repetition blindness—is\\nsupported by evidence from neuroimaging. You’ve been looking for your friend for\\nsome time without success. Have you missed her? Has she left? Some people are begin-\\nning to leave the party. As more and more people start looking for their coats, you be-\\ncome ever more vigilant in looking for a patch of green. Such expectations for the\\nappearance of a stimulus in time have also been reflected in activation of the fron-\\ntoparietal brain areas, suggesting that the voluntary attentional neural network oper-\\nates temporally as well as spatially (Coull et al., 2000; Wojciulik & Kanwisher, 1999).\\nIt is probably not surprising that after damage to this region, patients not only are im-\\npaired in attending to information on the side of space opposite the lesion (as in hemis-\\npatial neglect), they are also impaired in attending to information that is presented in a\\nrapid temporal stream.\\nEvidence from a completely different technique, transcranial magnetic imaging\\n(TMS), has also confirmed the critical role of parietal cortex in attention. This\\ntechnique, which was also discussed in Chapter 1, allows a magnetic field to be\\npassed through the neurons in a particular region of the brain, putting those\\nneurons into a state in which they are inhibited from being activated by incoming\\nstimuli. This technique, which is used with nonneurological participants, in effect\\ninduces a temporary “lesion” in healthy brains lasting a few seconds or minutes\\n(with no demonstrable consequences after the study is completed). TMS studies\\nwith normal participants can therefore be thought of as analogous to studies of\\npatients with damage to specific regions of the brain (such as patients with\\nhemispatial neglect). TMS applied to the right parietal cortex of normal partici-\\npants led them to require more time for conjunctive search but not for searches for\\nsimple features (Ashbridge et al., 1997). (Recall from earlier in the chapter that\\nconjunctive search, but not simple-feature search, requires attention.) Interestingly,\\nthis increased time to search after TMS can be eliminated by training participants\\non the conjunctive search task (Walsh et al., 1998), perhaps thus making it more\\nautomatic and less demanding of attention. Another TMS study, which disrupted\\nthe IPS in one or the other brain hemisphere, resulted in impaired detection of stim-\\nuli on the side of space opposite the site of TMS; but this was true only when two\\nstimuli were presented, one on the left and one on the right (Hilgetag et al., 2001).\\nTogether these studies appear to support the idea that the superior and posterior\\nparietal lobes are involved in attentional shifts, and that damage to these areas\\nresults in a bias for attention to be directed to the side of space that is registered by\\nthe “intact” hemisphere, as is true in hemispatial neglect.\\nThe ERP studies provide much support for early selection and enhancement of\\nvisual cortex processing during periods of attention; the PET and fMRI studies\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 138 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

These in-\\nclude parietal cortex and frontal cortex; imaging studies have also shown activation\\nin occipital cortex, confirming the ERP studies (Gandhi, et al., 1999). The most im-\\nportant message from these studies is that attention does not simply engage one area\\nof the brain. Rather, attention is implemented in a wide, distributed circuit to which\\ndifferent brain regions contribute. “Attention” involves selection that can occur\\nearly, late, or at both times, and be driven by our will or by the strength of stimuli in\\nthe environment and on the basis of space or objects or time. And so the most fruit-\\nful way of thinking about attention is as a dynamic system that flexibly allows for\\nselection in many different ways. These studies of neural systems in the human brain\\ncomplement the behavioral studies described in previous sections.\\nComprehension Check:\\n1. Describe two different methods that have been used to study the brain basis of\\nattention.\\n2. Do the ERP studies support an early or a late view of attentional selection? In\\nprinciple, could ERP results provide support for both views? If so, how? If not,\\nwhy not?\\n4. COMPETITION: A SINGLE EXPLANATORY FRAMEWORK \\nFOR ATTENTION?\\nConceptualizations of selective attention have undergone many transformations\\nover the history of attention studies. Early theories drew analogies between atten-\\ntion and a filtering mechanism or bottleneck that operated in accordance with a set\\nof early perceptual or later semantic criteria. Later theories recast attention as the\\nselective distribution of a limited amount of cognitive resources. Now attention\\nwas seen not as a discrete gateway or bottleneck but as a modulatory influence\\nthat could increase or decrease the efficiency with which demanding processing is\\nperformed. Considered in this way, attention is a far more flexible mechanism—\\ncapable of facilitating or inhibiting processing of the input—than a simple spotlight\\nor filter. Data from many differently designed studies have suggested ways in which\\nattention may be implemented in the brain; many different brain areas, from the\\nposterior occipital lobe, to the anterior frontal lobe, appear to be involved in\\nattentional processing.\\nIs there a general theory of attention that embraces the findings from neural\\nstudies and observed behavior? The answer is yes. This is the theory of biased com-\\npetition, or integrated competition, developed by Desimone and Duncan (1995) and\\nDuncan and colleagues (1997).\\nFrom the perspective of this theory, attention is seen as a form of competition\\namong different inputs that can take place between different representations at all\\nstages of processing.

A very strong bottom-up signal\\n(such as a shattering glass at a party) would be rapidly and efficiently processed,\\neven above the ambient noise of the party. Competition (and selection, which is the\\nresult of the competition) between noise-of-breaking-glass and general-noise-of-\\nparty would occur in auditory cortex. The same sort of competition would occur\\nwith inputs in other sensory modalities.\\nThe competition between inputs can be biased by the influence of other cogni-\\ntive systems. Focusing on visual processing, Desimone and Duncan (1995) argue that\\nattention is “an emergent property of many neural mechanisms working to resolve\\ncompetition for visual processing and control of behavior” (p. 194). Instead of char-\\nacterizing attention as a spotlight that highlights particular regions of space for pro-\\ncessing, or as a bottleneck or filter, these investigators characterize attention as an\\nintegral part of the perceptual or cognitive process itself. Competition occurs be-\\ncause it is impossible to process everything at once; attention acts as a bias that helps\\nresolve competition be tween inputs. So, for example, if the input contains a gray cir-\\ncle, competition would occur between different color representations (or the neurons\\nthat constitute the representations), and gray would win; the neurons of that repre-\\nsentation would fire, and gray would be considered the winning input. The source of\\nthe bias can come either from the features in the external stimulus (exogenous) or\\nfrom the relevance of a stimulus to one’s goals of the moment (endogenous).\\nThe competition that takes place between possible inputs occurs in multiple\\ndifferent brain regions. For example, competition in earlier areas of the visual sys-\\ntem will tend to be influenced by exogenous factors such as color or motion. This\\ncompetition will, in turn, affect more anterior brain regions to which these lower-\\nlevel areas send information for further processing. There, however, endogenous\\nfactors, such as relevance or goals, will tend to bias the competition in regions of\\nthe brain involved in formulating plans for how to pursue specific goals. This\\nlater competition can also send information back to the regions of lower-level pro-\\ncessing and modulate the influence of exogenous factors at that level. The theory\\nholds that many different brain regions are involved in such competition, and be-\\ncause they are connected, the competition is integrated across them. The ultimate\\nwinner of the competition—the item that is ultimately attended—is determined by\\na consensus among all the different regions working together. Given this perspec-\\ntive, findings that so many different brain areas contribute to attentional selection\\nare not surprising.\\nOne of the original motivations for the idea of competition came from a single-\\ncell recording study in which monkeys were trained to perform a visual search task\\n(Moran & Desimone, 1985). The important result was that when two targets were\\nin the same receptive field, they competed for the cell’s responses. However, when\\none of the objects was the target and the other was a distractor, the neuron re-\\nsponded primarily to the target stimulus and blocked processing of the distractor\\nstimulus. If you imagine these competitive processes occurring all along the process-\\ning stream, one way to understand attention is to think of it as a gating mechanism\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 140 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

Competition: A Single Explanatory Framework for Attention? 141\\nthat biases processing according to a combination of external salience and internal\\ngoals. The outcome of the competition is a winner that is selected for further, pref-\\nerential processing.\\nSeveral ERP and fMRI studies have shown how the ERP waveform or the acti-\\nvation of various brain regions is enhanced or magnified under conditions of com-\\npetition. These increases occur when participants perform more difficult\\ndiscriminations (Lavie, 1995), when distractors compete with targets, and when the\\ndemands of a task are increased. When task demands are increased as in dual-task\\nconditions, less activation is observed in areas associated with a simultaneous sec-\\nondary task, reflecting the decrease in processing of nonselected information.\\nCompetitive effects are also seen when stimuli appear simultaneously rather\\nthan sequentially, probably reflecting mutual suppression by simultaneously com-\\npeting stimuli. When four visual stimuli were present, there was less activation in\\nvisual cortical area V4 than when only one was present (Kastner et al., 1998). How-\\never, when participants were asked to attend to just one of the four stimuli that were\\npresented simultaneously, activation went up to a level similar to that observed with\\na single stimulus presented alone (see accompanying, A Closer Look box). In the\\nframework of integration competition theory, attending to a single object effectively\\nreduced the amount of competition from other stimuli and biased processing toward\\nthat stimulus.\\nOther demonstrations of attentional modulation, obtained with both fMRI and\\nERP techniques, have been found in V1 and other early visual cortical areas\\n(Brefczynski & DeYoe, 1999; Gandhi et al., 1999; Luck & Hillyard, 2000; Noesselt\\net al., 2002; Somers et al., 1999). some researchers have even found very early at-\\ntentional effects in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, a key informa-\\ntional relay station between the retina and visual cortex in the back of the brain\\n(O’Connor et al., 2002). These results indicate that, as the theory holds, information\\ncan be sent back to areas that accomplish earlier processing and thereby bias subse-\\nquent processing. Moreover, there is some suggestion that feedback connections to\\nearly visual cortex are involved in determining our conscious experience of visual in-\\nformation (Pascual-Leone & Walsh, 2001).\\nCompetition is also evident when a participant is required to divide attention\\nacross two perceptual features. Compared with a simple condition in which no stim-\\nulus appears on the screen and the participant stares at a fixation point, attending to\\nthe color or the shape of a stimulus that appears on the screen leads to greater acti-\\nvation of many visual areas. Moreover, if the participant has to switch between at-\\ntending to the color and attending to the shape, additional areas of the brain become\\nengaged and—no surprise—regions of parietal cortex are also active (Le et al., 1998;\\nLiu et al., 2003).\\nMany of the findings that demonstrate failures of selection in space or in time\\ncan be explained by the idea of competition between stimuli. For example, in\\ncovert attentional cueing (see Figure 3–7) the invalid trials can be thought of as\\ncases in which there is competition between the location indicated by the invalid\\ncue and the location where the target appears; in the valid condition, the location\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 141 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

The work, by Sabine Kastner, Peter De Weerd, Robert Desimone, and Leslie\\nUngerleider, was reported in 1998 in “Mechanisms of Directed Attention in the Human Extrastriate Cortex\\nas Revealed by Functional MRI,” Science, 282, 108–111.\\nIntroduction\\nThe investigators used fMRI to test ideas about competition and attentional selection. The idea being ex-\\nplored is that the visual system is limited in its capacity to process multiple stimuli at any given time. The\\nhypothesis: in order for objects to be selected, competition must occur between available objects to yield\\na “winner.” The suppression of the eventual winner by the “losing” stimuli would give rise to a reduction in\\nthe signal measured by fMRI. In addition, the investigators argue that this suppression can be overcome\\neven when multiple objects are present: if attention is directed to one of the objects specifically, the re-\\nsponse would be enhanced and lead to stronger fMRI signals.\\nMethod\\nEight participants viewed images appearing on a screen while lying in the fMRI scanner. Two conditions were\\nused in the first experiment. In the sequential condition, four complex images were shown in random loca-\\ntions on the screen but only one object was ever present at a single time. In contrast, in the simultaneous con-\\ndition, the same four complex images were present, but in this condition all four were present at the same\\ntime. Because competition (and suppression) can take place when all four are simultaneously present, the ex-\\npectation was that the fMRI signal from visual cortex in the simultaneous condition would be lower than the\\nsum of the four fMRI signals in the sequential condition. The second experiment was the same as the first but\\nnow, in some sets of trials, participants were instructed to attend to a particular location in which one stimu-\\nlus was presented and to count the occurrences of a particular target stimulus at that location.\\nResults\\nMarkedly weaker signals were observed in many visual areas of the brain in the simultaneous than in the\\nsequential condition, supporting the idea that the stimuli presented together competed with one another\\nand, in so doing, led to the suppression of some of them. When stimuli are presented one at a time, each\\ncan activate the brain fully and so the sequential condition leads to stronger fMRI signals. It is interesting\\nand important that in the second experiment, when the participants attended to the location of one of the\\nstimuli, there was an increase in the strength of the fMRI signal, and this signal was even larger than in the\\nsequential condition in some visual areas of the brain.\\nDiscussion\\nThe hypothesis was that competition among multiple stimuli would lead to suppression and that this would\\nbe reflected by a reduction in the fMRI signal. This was indeed the case, and this finding provides support\\nfor the idea that attention is a dynamic process in which stimuli compete for selection. Competition, then,\\nmay be the means by which unwanted stimuli are filtered out (they are suppressed and have little or no ac-\\ntivation). The second experiment shows that one can enhance some stimuli by attending to them even if\\nthere are many stimuli present; this finding shows that along with suppression, enhancement occurs when\\none selects a subset of items for further processing.\\nA CLOSER LOOK\\nCompetition and Selection\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 142 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

Competition: A Single Explanatory Framework for Attention? 143\\nof the valid cue and the location of the target are one and the same, and hence co-\\noperation rather than competition prevails. Also, the effects of divided attention\\ncan be interpreted as the result of competition between different inputs or differ-\\nent tasks, as opposed to the noncompetitive case, in which the focus is exclusively\\non a single input or a single task. The improvement, in the form of automaticity,\\nthat comes with greater practice with dual tasks may be thought of as a reduction\\nin the competition between the two tasks. Moreover, the performance of patients\\nwith hemispatial neglect can also be understood within this framework of compe-\\ntition. If the damage to the right side of the brain allows the intact hemisphere to\\nproduce a bias away from the left side and toward the right side, that bias in-\\ncreases the competitive strength of right-sided stimuli and reduces that of left-sided\\nstimuli.\\nFailures of selection in time lend themselves to a similar explanation. The\\nfailure to report T2 in the attentional blink task (see Figure 3–4) might arise from\\ncompetition between T1 and T2. Reporting T2 when it is not preceded by T1 is\\nnot problematic—there is no competition. However, the requirement to report T2\\nwhen it is preceded by T1 and is very similar to T1 in appearance (say, the letters\\nare “A” and “H”) establishes a highly competitive environment and reduces the\\nchances of detection of T2. Competition may also explain the failures of selection\\nin time observed with patients with hemispatial neglect. When visual stimuli are\\npresented on both sides, reporting of the stimulus on the neglected side improves\\ndepending on the timing of presentation of the two stimuli and their grouping.\\nOne might think of these two factors, time and grouping, as biases that can\\ninfluence the outcome of the competition between stimuli on the right and on\\nthe left.\\nIt seems, then, that almost all the behavioral experiments we have discussed\\ncan be interpreted in terms of a competition between “stronger” and “weaker”\\nstimuli, with strength defined by a combination of bottom-up and top-down\\ninfluences. Although not all the details of biased competition have been worked\\nout yet, this framework allows us to explain a wide range of findings; its direc-\\ntion is promising. The advantage of this theory is that it underscores the idea that\\nattention is a bias in processing, and that processing occurs through cooperative\\nand competitive interactions among brain areas. Because the different brain\\nareas are connected, they will all contribute to the selection of the target. By com-\\nbining the behavioral results with the inferred involvement of particular brain\\nareas, it is possible to begin to develop an understanding of how attentional\\neffects are manifested in the neural system and how those changes affect cognition\\nand behavior.\\nComprehension Check:\\n1.

What is attention, and how does it operate during cognition?\\nAttention is the process whereby we can select from among the many competing\\nstimuli present in our environment, facilitating processing of some while inhibit-\\ning processing of others. This selection can be driven endogenously by our goals\\n(e.g., to find a particular friend, to follow an instruction, to use an arrow to direct\\nattention), or exogenously by a salient or novel stimulus that captures attention\\naway from the task at hand (e.g., bright light, loud noise). Because there is too\\nmuch information at any given moment for us to cope with, attention is the mech-\\nanism by which the most important information is selected for further processing.\\nThe type of information that we miss and the conditions under which we miss it\\nare, therefore, the flip side of the cognitive processes involved in attentional selec-\\ntion. Being unaware of the posters on the wall at a party is a failure of selection\\nthat is a property of selectively searching for features of a friend. Although we are\\ncapable of processing only a limited quantity of information in both space and\\ntime, fortunately selection does not occur randomly. Both our goals and the\\nsalience of information around us determine where and to what we attend. This\\nbalance between endogenous and exogenous factors not only allows us to accom-\\nplish our goals effectively, such as finding an individual in a crowd, but also to be\\nsensitive to important external information, such as a fire alarm or crashing glass.\\nThink Critically\\n■ Describe the differences between endogenous and exogenous attentional pro-\\ncessing in space and in time.\\n■ What would it be like if you were equally aware of all the visual and auditory\\ndetails of your environment at once? Would this be an advantage or a disad-\\nvantage?\\n■ Does studying in a noisy environment such as a coffee shop help you focus or\\ndoes it distract you?

What information-processing models have been devised to understand atten-\\ntion?\\nDifferent models of attention have each been successful in capturing particular\\naspects of attentional processing. The debate over whether attention operates at\\nan early or late stage highlighted two aspects of attention. First, attention can\\nhave an effect on the very earliest levels of perceptual processing by reducing the\\namount of information that enters into our cognitive system. Second, some unat-\\ntended information reaches very late stages of processing, which shows that not\\n144 CHAPTER 3 Attention\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 144 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

Information that is contextually\\nconsistent with our goals or likely to be of extreme importance, such as our name,\\npenetrates the attentional filter. The spotlight metaphor for attention reflected the\\nreality that space is a powerful coordinate system for our perceptual systems, and\\nthat attention operates on these sensory systems directly. For example, turning to-\\nward the sound of crashing glass at a party might result in the incidental selection\\nof other things in that spatial location such as a piece of furniture, which you\\nwould have otherwise failed to notice. Later theories, such as feature integration\\ntheory and guided search, proposed more complex models of attention that in-\\nvolved early preattentive and later attentive stages of processing. These theories\\nprovided a mechanism for how attention integrates information. As theories\\nchange over time, they build on ideas from previous theories and increase in the\\ndetail of explanation. In this way, our understanding of attention builds over time.\\nThink Critically\\n■ According to research findings, would it be more effective to search for your\\nfriend at a crowded party along a particular dimension (e.g., color of her dress,\\nher height) or in terms of a combination of dimensions?

How have new techniques for studying the brain enhanced our understanding of\\nattention?\\nTogether, ERP, TMS, PET, and fMRI studies have corroborated and extended\\ninformation-processing concepts of attention. They have shown that attention\\nmodulates processing in early sensory areas such as the primary visual cortex\\nbut that the attentional signal may be generated from processing in the parietal\\nand frontal lobes. The parietal and frontal areas associated with attention are\\nseparated into two neural systems that are interconnected. The more dorsal sys-\\ntem is involved in endogenous attention and tightly connected with the motor\\nsystems that produce eye and other body movements. This system underlies the\\nvoluntary selection of relevant information and the transformation of it into dis-\\ncrete actions, such as moving one’s eyes toward a person in green. The more ven-\\ntral system is sensitive to the appearance of new exogenous stimuli, such as the\\nsound of breaking glass, and this system can modulate, and be modulated by sig-\\nnals from the dorsal system. The results suggest that the attentional system in\\nthe brain involves highly interconnected areas that interact to produce effective\\nselection of relevant information.\\nSMITMC03_0131825089.QXD  3/11/06  1:46 PM  Page 145 REVISED PAGES'),\n",

Attention, according to one contemporary theory, is a competition among dif-\\nferent sources of information, all vying for further processing.

Attention as a biasing signal acts within as well as between perceptual\\nand cognitive systems. The outcome of the bias present in one phase of process-\\ning is passed on to other phases and acts as a bias there. The effects of competi-\\ntion are dynamic, just as experiments have shown attentional effects to be.\\nAccording to the competition framework, the reason why it is so difficult to find\\nyour friend in a crowded room is because there are too many competing objects\\nthat are either too similar, such as other people, or too salient, such as crashing\\nglass and loud voices. Your friend, as an object, does not immediately win the\\ncompetition for processing. If the party were less crowded or noisy, it would be\\neasier for properties of your friend to be selected and other properties to be in-\\nhibited.

THE NATURE AND ROLES OF ATTENTION\\nAlthough we have an intuitive understanding of what it means to “pay attention” to\\nan object or event, the study of attention has a long and checkered history in cogni-\\ntive psychology, filled with debate and disagreement. Some have suggested that\\n“everyone knows what attention is;” others have countered that “no one knows what\\nattention is” (Pashler, 1998).

Still others have used terms such as\\narousal, effort, capacity, perceptual set, control, and consciousness as synonymous\\nwith the process of attention. Adding to the difficulty is the problem of designing and\\ncarrying out careful and systematic studies of attention, for the very reason that at-\\ntentional selection seems to occur so naturally and effortlessly that it is difficult to pin\\ndown experimentally.\\nNonetheless, there is broad agreement that attention involves selecting some in-\\nformation for further processing and inhibiting other information from receiving\\nfurther processing.
